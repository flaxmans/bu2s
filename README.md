# bu2s

BU2S is a forward-time, mutation-based, infinite-sites, individual-based, stochastic population genetic simulator.
It includes mutation, selection, migration, recombination, and drift.  A full explanation of the biological scenarios simulated with this program can be found in the following two publications:

1. Schilling MP, Mullen SP, Kronforst M, Safran RJ, Nosil P, Feder JL, Gompert Z, Flaxman SM. Transitions from Single- to Multi-Locus Processes during Speciation with Gene Flow. Genes 2018, 9(6), 274. [doi: 10.3390/genes9060274](https://doi.org/10.3390/genes9060274)

Example data sets produced by the code for the publications above are available at DataDryad.org ([http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kc596](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.kc596) and [http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t894r](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t894r)), and also at [http://bit.ly/2s6jeIf](http://bit.ly/2s6jeIf) for Schilling et al. 2018. 

Additional capabilities since the publication of those articles includes (1) modeling neutral sites in the genome and (2) collection of additional population genetic metrics.

System Requirements for compiling and running the program:

* a Linux/UNIX-style terminal or terminal emulator
* a C compiler (gcc is the default in the Makefile)
* the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* make

To use:

(1) Download the "Source" directory from this GitHub repository.

(2) In a Linux/UNIX terminal type the following (not the dollar signs; those represent the prompt):
    
    $ cd Source
    $ make clean
    $ make

The executable generated by make ("bu2s") can then be run with the command:
    
    $ ./bu2s

A list of command line options and their explanations can be obtained with the command:
    
    $ ./bu2s -?
